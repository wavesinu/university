Greek mythology is a collection of stories and beliefs that originated in ancient Greece.
It is a rich and complex system of myths, gods, goddesses, heroes, and creatures that were believed to be real by the ancient Greeks.
The myths explain the creation of the world, the origins of humanity, and the lives and actions of the gods and goddesses. 

The Greek gods and goddesses were believed to live on Mount Olympus, the highest mountain in Greece.
There were twelve main gods and goddesses, known as the Olympians, who were the most powerful and important deities in the Greek pantheon.
These included Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Aphrodite, Hephaestus, Hermes, and Dionysus.

Each god and goddess had their own unique personality, powers, and symbols.
For example, Zeus was the king of the gods and the god of thunder and lightning, while Athena was the goddess of wisdom and warfare.
Many of the gods and goddesses had multiple roles and responsibilities.

In addition to the Olympians, there were also many other gods and goddesses in Greek mythology, such as Hades, the god of the underworld, and Pan, the god of nature and fertility.
There were also numerous heroes and creatures, such as Heracles (Hercules), the Minotaur, and the Sphinx.

Greek mythology has had a significant impact on Western culture, influencing everything from literature and art to philosophy and science.
Many famous works of literature, such as Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, are based on Greek mythology.
The stories and characters of Greek mythology continue to captivate and inspire people around the world today.
